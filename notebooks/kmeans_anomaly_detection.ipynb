    "# 1. Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection: K-Means\n",

    "## Concept & Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- The core idea behind using k-means for anomaly detection is to group data points into clusters. Normal data points will tend to be close to the center of a cluster (centroid), while anomalies will be far from any cluster centroid. The distance of a data point from its nearest cluster centroid can be used as an anomaly score."
