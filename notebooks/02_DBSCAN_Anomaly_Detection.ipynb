    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm. The main idea is that a point is a core point if it has at least a minimum number of other points (MinPts) within a given radius (epsilon). Clusters are built by connecting core points that are close to each other. Points that are not part of any cluster are considered noise, which makes DBSCAN naturally suited for anomaly detection."

    "- **Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.**: It is not limited to spherical clusters.\n",
    "- **Does not require specifying the number of clusters.**: The algorithm finds the number of clusters on its own.\n",
    "- **Robust to outliers**: DBSCAN is designed to identify and handle noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "- **Sensitive to parameters**: The choice of `eps` and `MinPts` can be difficult and has a large impact on the results.\n",
    "- **Struggles with varying density**: It can be challenging to find a good set of parameters for clusters with varying densities.\n",
    "- **Curse of dimensionality**: The distance metric can be less meaningful in high-dimensional spaces."
