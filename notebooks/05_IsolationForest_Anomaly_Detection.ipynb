    "Isolation Forest is an ensemble-based anomaly detection algorithm. The core idea is that anomalies are \"few and different\" and therefore easier to isolate than normal points. The algorithm builds an ensemble of isolation trees (iTrees) for the data. To isolate a data point, the algorithm recursively partitions the data until the point is isolated. The number of partitions required to isolate a point is its path length. Anomalies are expected to have shorter path lengths than normal points."

    "1. **iTree Construction**: An iTree is a binary tree where each node represents a partition of the data. A random feature and a random split value are chosen to partition the data at each node.\n",
    "2. **Path Length**: The path length *h(x)* of a point *x* is the number of edges from the root of the iTree to the node where *x* is isolated.\n",
    "3. **Anomaly Score**: The anomaly score *s(x, n)* for a point *x* is calculated as:\n",
    "   $$ s(x, n) = 2^{-\\frac{E(h(x))}{c(n)}} $$",
    "   where *E(h(x))* is the average path length of *x* over all iTrees, and *c(n)* is the average path length of an unsuccessful search in a Binary Search Tree, given by:\n",
    "   $$ c(n) = 2H(n-1) - (2(n-1)/n) $$",
    "   where *H(i)* is the harmonic number, which can be estimated as *ln(i) + 0.5772156649* (Euler's constant).\n",
    "   - If the score is close to 1, the point is likely an anomaly.\n",
    "   - If the score is less than 0.5, the point is likely a normal point.\n",
    "   - If all scores are close to 0.5, then the entire sample does not seem to have any distinct anomalies."
