    "Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is a density-based anomaly detection algorithm that measures the local deviation of the density of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. The core idea is to identify outliers by comparing the local density of a point to the local densities of its neighbors. Points in areas of lower density than their neighbors are considered outliers."

    "- **Works well with varying density clusters.**: It can handle clusters with different densities.\n",

    "- **Computationally expensive**: The calculation of the LOF score can be slow for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Curse of dimensionality**: The distance metric can be less meaningful in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- **Parameter sensitive**: The choice of *k* (the number of neighbors) can be challenging."
