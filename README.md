# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: A Graduate-Level Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive, graduate-level educational guide to unsupervised learning algorithms for anomaly detection. It includes conceptual explanations, key mathematical ideas, and Python code examples for each algorithm, enabling the learner to understand, implement, and compare these methods effectively.

## Algorithms Covered

This guide covers the following major categories of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms:

*   **Clustering-based methods:** (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN)
*   **Density-based methods:** (e.g., Local Outlier Factor)
*   **Statistical methods:** (e.g., Gaussian models)
*   **Model-based methods:** (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders)

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the implementation and application of each algorithm.
*   `src/`: Contains Python source code for the algorithms and utility functions.
*   `data/`: Contains example datasets used in the notebooks.

## Getting Started

To get started, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. Each notebook provides a self-contained guide to a specific algorithm, including theory, implementation, and examples.

## Further Experimentation

I encourage you to experiment with the following:

*   **Different datasets**: Try these algorithms on your own datasets or other standard benchmark datasets for anomaly detection.
*   **Parameter tuning**: The performance of these algorithms is often sensitive to the choice of parameters. Experiment with different parameter values to see how they affect the results.
*   **Combining models**: Ensemble methods and other techniques can be used to combine the outputs of multiple anomaly detection algorithms to improve performance.

I hope this guide has been a valuable learning resource. If you would like a deeper dive into any of these algorithms or want to explore other real-world use cases, please feel free to ask!
