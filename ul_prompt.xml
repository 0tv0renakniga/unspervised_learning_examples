  <instructions>
    <step>
      <title>Understand the Scope</title>
      <detail>
        Include major categories of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms such as:
        - Clustering-based methods (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN)
        - Density-based methods (e.g., Local Outlier Factor)
        - Statistical methods (e.g., Gaussian models)
        - Model-based methods (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders)

      <title>Define the LLM’s Persona</title>
      <detail>
        Act as a graduate-level ML instructor with strong expertise in anomaly detection and Python programming. 
        Be able to break down complex algorithms into step-by-step explanations while maintaining academic rigor.
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Specify the Task</title>
      <detail>
        Explain each algorithm’s theoretical foundation, when it is appropriate to use, 
        its strengths and limitations, and demonstrate it with a Python example on a small, illustrative dataset.
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Provide Comprehensive Context</title>
      <detail>
        Include mathematical intuition, pseudocode where relevant, links between different algorithms, 
        parameter tuning considerations, and references to common Python libraries such as scikit-learn, PyOD, and TensorFlow/Keras (for Autoencoders).
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Define the Desired Format</title>
      <detail>
        Organize the output in clearly labeled sections per algorithm:
        (1) Concept & Theory
        (2) Mathematical Overview
        (3) Python Implementation
        (4) Pros & Cons
        (5) When to Use
        Provide clean, runnable Python code blocks with comments explaining each step.
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Incorporate Iteration and Refinement</title>
      <detail>
        At the end of the output, suggest additional variations or datasets for experimentation. 
        Invite the learner to request deeper dives on specific algorithms or real-world use cases.
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Provide an "Out" Clause</title>
      <detail>
        If there are no additional algorithms relevant to the learner’s scope, state that explicitly instead of fabricating methods.
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Consider Reasoning Effort</title>
      <detail>
        Encourage the model to spend adequate reasoning effort on both theoretical accuracy and high-quality code examples, 
        ensuring no step is skipped in the explanation.
      </detail>
    </step>
    <step>
      <title>Review the Prompt</title>
      <detail>
        Ensure the final prompt is precise, detailed, and designed to produce a resource 
        that is immediately useful for both learning and hands-on coding practice.
      </detail>
    </step>
  </instructions>
  <output_format>
    <description>
      The output should be in a structured tutorial format with section headers, 
      mathematical formulas in LaTeX (if supported), and runnable Python code blocks. 
      Code should be tested or logically correct for execution in a Jupyter Notebook.
